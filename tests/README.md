# Automatic Tests of Falkor/dotfiles

These tests are based on [Bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats): Bash Automated Testing System.
Coupled with [Travis-CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/), it offers a nice continuous integration framework -- see [Travis CI for Complete Beginners](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners)


## Pre-requisites

### Bats installation

I made a `setup_bats.sh` script for that (also for easier integration with travis) which roughly performs the following actions:

* On Mac OS: use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install the `bats` package
* On Linux system, a manual installation is performed under `/tmp/local/bin` (to ensure a full compliance with Travis virtualized boxes), which consists in:

   ```bash
   $> git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/bats.git /tmp/bats
   $> mkdir -p /tmp/local
   $> bash /tmp/bats/install.sh /tmp/local
   $> export PATH=$PATH:/tmp/local/bin
   ```


### Travis integration

Take a look at the repository [.travis.yml](../.travis.yml)

## Directory Layout

```bash
tests/
├── *.bats            # The bats files, each defining a set of unit tests
├── README.md         # This file
└── setup_bats.sh     # run/source this file to install Bats on your system
```

## Run the tests

Simply run

     $> bats .       # from the tests directory

OR, from the root repository

     $> make tests   # from the root directory of the dotfiles repository
