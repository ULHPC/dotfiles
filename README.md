# User configuration files

These are the default configuration files for `bash`, `screen`, `vim` etc. for
the ULHPC environment.

In the sequel, when providing a command, `$>` denotes a prompt and is not part
of the commands.

## Pre-requisites

You should install the following elements to use the full functionality of
these config files:

* bash
* bash-completions
* screen
* git
* subversion
* vim

## Installation

Run the following commands:

    $> git clone https://github.com/ULHPC/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    $> ~/.dotfiles/install.sh

## Environment

These config files have been tested on Debian Linux but should work on any other
unix-like system, eventually with a little tweaking.
